                                    artist, and designer with an obsession for the geometry and how it is
                                    related to the natural world we all live in. Expressing my inner visions of
                                    how I understand this geometry, my work explores the realms of the
                                    Sacred Geometry, the Visionary art, the Esoteric, the Occult, the Symbolism,
                                    the psychedelic… I like to charge my pieces with a deep meaning, usually related to
                                    natural elements.

                                    worldwide, but most of them are located in the United States. I do also
