                                    My name is Guifré Urgell Tasies (Tàrrega, 1988), and I created the Illustration
                                    Studio
                                    YANTRART DESIGN. I am a Spanish freelance illustrator,
                                    artist, and designer with an obsession for the geometry and how it is
                                    related to the natural world we all live in. Expressing my inner visions of
                                    how I understand this geometry, my work explores the realms of the
                                    Sacred Geometry, the Visionary art, the Esoteric, the Occult, the Symbolism,
                                    the psychedelic… I like to charge my pieces with a deep meaning, usually related to
                                    natural elements.

                                    a traditional painter and muralist. I use to work for big apparel brands
                                    worldwide, but most of them are located in the United States. I do also
                                    graphic and logotype design, custom tattoo designs, custom paintings, sculpture
                                    and installations, interior and home decoration, and all I
                                    can to keep improving my skills!
